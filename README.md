# 🛒 Mock Amazon Scraper Project

![Banner](https://github.com/dhananjayaDev/mini-web-scraping/blob/main/web%20scrape%20project%20banner.png)

A modular mini-project that simulates a dynamic e-commerce store and showcases web scraping skills using **BeautifulSoup**, **Selenium**, and **Flask**. Built with recruiter appeal in mind—clean UI, editable data, and live scraping feedback.

---

##  Project Overview

This repo contains two Flask apps:

### 1. `mock_store/` – Editable Mock Amazon Store
- Amazon-style product cards with images, ratings, and delivery info
- Inline price editing for each item
- Bootstrap-styled layout for professional polish

### 2. `scraper_viewer/` – Scraped Product Viewer
- Scrapes the mock store using BeautifulSoup
- Displays products in the same layout, but read-only
- Optionally saves scraped data to `scraped_data.json`

```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
